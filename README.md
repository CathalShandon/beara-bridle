# Beara Horse Trail

Straddling counties Cork and Kerry, the Beara peninsula in southwest Ireland is one of Ireland’s most compelling and beautiful locations. The Miskish and the Caha mountains form the rugged spine of the peninsula which pokes into the wild Atlantic ocean ensuring that the coastline is ever-present. 

This maritime influence allows subtropical trees and shrubs to escape domesticity and go native in the endless hedgerows lining the leisurely roads that meander between Beara’s cosy, colourful villages and parishes. The peninsula is densely studded with Bronze Age remains: wedge tombs, stone circles and standing stones. 

The Beara Bridle Way is a  linear route. Riders can start in Clonglaskin west of Castletownbere or in Allihies or Urhan. There is a short loop route in Allihies and plans are in place two extend the trail and make three loops. Parking is available in Clonglaskin, Allihies , by the Urhan  Inn  and Travara beach  .

## Website templates



## iv. Skeleton / Technical design <a name="skeleton"></a> 

I used Balsamiq to create wireframes for my project in order to plan out the layout of the interface, navigation and information design of the site on desktop, tablets and mobile devices.

# 3. Testing <a name="testing"></a> 

### Responsiveness 

Throughout the site is tested to ensure all pages are displayed appropriately in all screen sizes



# 4. Deployment <a name="deployment"></a> 

### Deployment
Here is the deployment procedure  that I have taken to deploy this project on Heroku

1. In the Heroku dashboard, click new, then enter the app name and specify the region.

2. In the Add-on section in the resources tab, search postgres, then select Heroku Postgres and submit order from button in the popup window.

3. In the setting tab, click on Reveal Config Vars button then copy the value for DATABASE_URL key.

4. Create env.py directly under the repo directory same lavel as manage.py and make sure the file name is included in .gitignore as this is a setting for local development site in Gitpod. 
Heroku Config vars need to be set accordingly including DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY

5. In setting.py file include followings:

    import os
    import dj_database_url
    if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
        import env
    modify SECRET_KEY line to SECRET_KEY = os.
    environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

    Replace DATABASES as
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }

6. In the Gitpod terminal, migrate the change by
python3 manage.py migrate. Check the resource tab in heroku and choose 
Heroku Postgres then ensure the changes are reflected in the database

7. Login to Cloudinary and copy the API Environment variable and paste in env.py and also Config Vars in Heroku.

8. DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC set to 1 in Config Vars in Heroku as the initial deployment does not contain static files yet.

9. In setting.py configure followings:
 
    * Add 'cloudinary_storage', before 'django.contrib.staticfiles', and 'cloudinary' after it.

    * Set STATICFILES_DIRS, STATICFILES_DIRS, STATIC_ROOT, MEDIA_URL and DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE so that Django can use the directories appropriately.

    * Set TEMPLATES_DIR just below BASE_DIR and insert TEMPLATES_DIR in TEMPLATES array
    'DIRS': []

    * Set ALLOWED_HOSTS array as 'tailsontrails.herokuapp.com', 'localhost'

10. Create Procfile with the contents 

    web: gunicorn tails_on_trails.wsgi

11. In the deployment tab in Heroku page, connect to GitHub and search for the repository then Connect.

    Click on Deploy Branch
