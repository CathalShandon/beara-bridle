# Beara Horse Trail

Straddling counties Cork and Kerry, the Beara peninsula in southwest Ireland is one of Ireland’s most compelling and beautiful locations. The Miskish and the Caha mountains form the rugged spine of the peninsula which pokes into the wild Atlantic ocean ensuring that the coastline is ever-present. 

This maritime influence allows subtropical trees and shrubs to escape domesticity and go native in the endless hedgerows lining the leisurely roads that meander between Beara’s cosy, colourful villages and parishes. The peninsula is densely studded with Bronze Age remains: wedge tombs, stone circles and standing stones. 

The Beara Bridle Way is a  linear route. Riders can start in Clonglaskin west of Castletownbere or in Allihies or Urhan. There is a short loop route in Allihies and plans are in place two extend the trail and make three loops. Parking is available in Clonglaskin, Allihies , by the Urhan  Inn  and Travara beach  .
